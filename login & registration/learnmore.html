        <h1>The bedrock of farmers</h1>
        <p>With a constantly flourishing family of 17 million+ farmers and 400+ partner brands, SeedSage continues to revolutionize the digital agri-ecosystem in India.
            Our multi-channel approach helps farmers unlock new dimensions of agriculture in the country.

            To bring new meaning and hope to farmer's lives, SeedSage strives to enable holistic farming solutions that empower farmers in making informed farming 
            decisions, safeguarding their crops, accessing untapped global markets, getting fair prices, and reaping maximum benefits.
        </p>
        <h1>Our business</h1>
        <p>SeedSage's aim is to empower the farming community and enable them to take well informed decisions by delivering the right set of information, products,
            and services at their disposal. We help farmers to increase and improve productivity while adhering to the highest domestic and international market 
            standards. With our customer first philosophy, we also enable farmers get the best price for their produce by safeguarding fair and transparent pricing 
            through our market linkage programs.
        </p>
        <h1>SeedSage's Sustainability Development Program</h1>
        <p>In recent years, seedSage has been committed to designing and launching a "Sustainability Development Program" facilitating backward integration adapted 
            to IPM practices. Quality assurance discriminates use of inputs to maximize yields with an uninterrupted supply chain model and price benefits for the 
            farmers.

            SeedSage's on-farm team facilitates knowledge sharing and handholding of Good Agronomical Practices (GAP), ensuring safe farming techniques.

            This data-driven farmer-centric program encourages formulating, implementing, and regulating food-safe agrochemical practices in accordance with 
            international standards.
        </p>
        <h1>Market linkage</h1>    
        <p>Our ideology to share the future of farmers doesn't end at the pre-harvest stage. The purpose of Market Linkage is to bridge the gap between the farmer 
            and the market to sell their produce at best prices hassle-free.

            Through AgroHaat (a trading company and subsidiary of SeedSage) we help farmers get fair price realization, direct market accessibility, technical 
            guidance, and on-time payments of crops sold.
            
            Additionally, we also add value for clie  nts we partner with in terms of ensured supply of their commodities, meeting their criteria in terms of both 
            quality and quantity.
